> [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics)
> Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999.
